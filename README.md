General Description:
Our app is a game where the player controls a ball, utilizing the phone’s gyro controls, to complete mazes. More specifically, as the player tilts and rotates their phone, rotating the maze, the ball moves along the maze as gravity pulls it down. There will be different maze levels that the player can pick from, each varying in difficulty. The goal of the game is to complete the maze as fast as possible while collecting stars, our game’s currency, along the way. The player will have completed the level upon reaching the exit, wherein the player will be rewarded with additional star currencies based on their completion time. 
These collected stars can then be used to unlock various customization options. This includes purchasing cosmetic effects for the ball like skins, trails, and effects. It can also be used to customize the mazes, such as the background gradient and the wall skin. The background music and sound effects can also be purchased and customized using the star currency. 

Dependencies: None

Special Instructions: IOS should be 17.5, Iphone should 4+. Must be played on Iphone and not a simulator.
